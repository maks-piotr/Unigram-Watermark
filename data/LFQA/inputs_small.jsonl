Probably a majority are against \"banning all guns\", but enough oppose *any* sort of gun restrictions to stop any laws about it from being passed at the federal level.

Add the prison terms for all of those convictions up and you get 88-120 years. Obviously no person old enough to commit those crimes is living an additional 120 years.

Sometimes, it's the judge's discretion, and they might take into account the number and severity of the charges and any prior criminal history.
