Some common examples of something unlawful but not criminal might include committing a civil wrong against a person (say, breaking your lease), or being late in paying a fine, or remaining in the country without legal status.\nWhen the government itself fails to comply with a statute or regulation, that too is more likely to be termed \u201cunlawful\u201d than \u201cillegal.\u201d", "gen_completion": [" The distinction is that unlawful means something that is contrary to law and illegal means contrary or contrary in law.

What does it mean when someone says something is illegal or unlawful? What are some examples? Is it something like stealing or lying? Or does something have to do with morality? For instance, what does lying mean? Does it have something to with morals? And what about stealing? Can someone lie and still be guilty of stealing if it's something moral? I know it seems like I'm asking for an answer but I want to know what I should do if I find something I think is wrong or illegal and I can't find an explanation for it. I feel like it should be something easy but it feels like there's no easy answer. Is there any way I could find one? Also, I was wondering if there are any laws or regulations that I would have if something was illegal but not illegal in my country? Like if my parents had a law saying I couldn't go to the park and drink beer and smoke cigarettes and it was still illegal for me to go but if they had no law it wouldn't make any sense? So I guess I am asking if what's illegal can be made legal? But I don't know if that's true or not? Any advice would really help me. Thank you so much for all your time and advice."]}

She was a child who grew up in the entertainment industry was a chart topper for many years as a solo artist. In the mid 2000's she began a series of erratic behavior such as a questionable marriage and highly publicized emotional breakdowns. As a result her parents were able to get a court order that essentially removed her ability to control her own life/free will. In this legal process her ability to chose where/when how to live, work, spend her money; basically many any independent choices were removed from her.

There are many things we can know for sure and many we cannot know. But we do know some things for certain and some we know we will never know or can only know as theories.\nQ. What are some examples?\nThere are things such as the laws of physics and the theory of relativity. These are theories and we are certain we understand them. However, we still cannot prove it wrong or right. They are true but we don't know what will happen if we break them or if they are broken. So we say we have no proof for it but it still exists. That's what we mean by \"not proven\".\nAnother example is the fact that we all know that if you put two and two together, you will get four. We know this for a fact and it does not mean we never will know otherwise. It means we think it will be four but can we prove that? No we cant. And we would never want to know the answer to that question. Why? Because we want it to be one and if its two we feel we should feel bad and feel sorry for ourselves for being wrong. If it was four we wouldn't feel so bad for breaking it and feeling sorry. Our feelings would be more positive and positive feelings are what make us feel better and happier."]}
{"prefix": "Q: explain prison sentences more years then someone could reasonably live\nA:", "gold_completion": "If you\u2019ve committed multiple crimes that each carry a life sentence, receiving multiple life sentences is a symbolic way to ensure \u201cfairness\u201d to the victims; you\u2019re being punished for every crime you committed.", "gen_completion": [" I am not sure I understand what you mean by that. I think it's more than one year. The average life expectancy for an American male is 79. So if someone was convicted of a violent crime and was sentenced to life without parole, it would mean that they would never be eligible for parole again. They would be dead long before they ever had the opportunity to apply for it again and apply again for another life sentence. That's what I mean when I say it is more then one life.\nQ. What do you think would happen if we did not have mandatory life sentences?\nIf we had mandatory sentences for all violent crimes, we would see an increase in violent offenders and an increased prison population. There would still be some violent criminals but it wouldn't be as many as we see today. And we wouldn`t see as much prison overcrowding as there is today and we`d see less violence and less prison violence as well."]}
{"prefix": "Q: Why snitches get stitches\nA:", "gold_completion": "That only works if the people to whom you are snitching are all benevolent and their punishments are fair. Most criminal justice systems are still rife with abuses of power and systemic racism. A lot of crimes are directly a result of people being forced to live in systems of oppression. Many gangs were originally created to protect communities that were being either brutalized or ignored by law enforcement. A lot of drug dealers say they got into dealing because it was the only way they could imagine making enough money to buy nice things and provide for their families.   \n@@@In the US, the prison population is predominantly BIPOC and low-income, meaning they've experienced a lot of oppression before they entered. They may not have had access to adequate legal representation because our public defenders are criminally overworked. They're exploited for free or cheap labor (watch the 13th by Ava Duvernay), and they leave in debt and a record that will disqualify them from some jobs and housing and come up in background checks for those that are available.   \n@@@So, for a lot of incarcerated people, snitching is not going to protect people. It is going to serve the oppressors and offer up another person to be abused by the system. Even if you hate the \"bad guy,\" you may not want to see him fucked over by your greater enemy.   \n@@@Also, there's a long history of \"jailhouse snitches\" who lied. Sometimes they make up whatever they think will get them the best deal (usually years off their sentence), and sometimes law enforcement purposefully houses a snitch with someone awaiting trial so that they can get a \"confession.\"", "gen_completion": [" They are often forced to do so by their captors.

For example, if we want to go swimming or go to the bathroom, then we can wear swim trunks or pants. But if it's going for something else, such as going shopping or going out for a date, it should be something we feel comfortable in. And if someone else wants to dress as we do, so be it. However, when we go for an activity we know we will not be comfortable or comfortable clothes are not necessary.

What was it like for you when you first heard about the shooting? Did it make you feel any differently? Or did it seem normal? What did you think? And what did your wife think when she heard? A: My wife was at my house and she was crying and saying, \"You're going to jail for this?\" And then I called my wife and said, I can't believe it, and then we went and talked to my lawyer and we talked about it and my daughter was there and all my friends and family and everything and they all thought it had to be an honest mistake and that it couldn't be true. So I had no problem at all. My daughter and wife are still my best friends. They're still close friends today and still talk and text and stuff.

{"prefix": "Q: If a person is in court because he is guilty of a crime, why is he given a lawyer to defend him in the case even though he is guilty?\nA:", "gold_completion": "A person is not on trial for being guilty of a crime, they are on trial for being accused of a crime.", "gen_completion": [" The law says that if a defendant is convicted of an offense and if he or she is unable to afford an attorney, then the court will appoint one for him or her.

What are some examples of what can happen if someone is arrested and taken to jail? What can they do? Can they make phone calls? Is it possible for them to make a phone call? A: There are many ways for someone arrested to be taken into custody and for their charges to become final. For example, if an officer sees someone driving without a valid license or registration, or if they see someone walking or standing on the street without permission, an arrest can occur. If an individual is stopped for a traffic violation or for some other violation, such as an open container violation for alcohol or drugs, and the officer suspects that the person has committed a serious crime such a violent or serious violent crime or a violation of probation or parole, the police officer can make an immediate arrest and charge the individual with the crime. However, it is important to remember that an arrested person can still make calls and can contact their lawyer if necessary. They can also contact an experienced criminal defense lawyer for advice and assistance."]}
