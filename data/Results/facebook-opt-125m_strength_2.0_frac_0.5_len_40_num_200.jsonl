Some common examples of something unlawful but not criminal might include committing a civil wrong against a person (say, breaking your lease), or being late in paying a fine, or remaining in the country without legal status.\nWhen the government itself fails to comply with a statute or regulation, that too is more likely to be termed \u201cunlawful\u201d than \u201cillegal.\u201d", "gen_completion": [" Is it the government paying you for something when you get it done correctly?

She was a child who grew up in the entertainment industry was a chart topper for many years as a solo artist. In the mid 2000's she began a series of erratic behavior such as a questionable marriage and highly publicized emotional breakdowns. As a result her parents were able to get a court order that essentially removed her ability to control her own life/free will. In this legal process her ability to chose where/when how to live, work, spend her money; basically many any independent choices were removed from her. In a sense she is a slave to her legal guardians. \nShe has recently begun a highly publicized legal attempt to have these guard rails removed from her life and basically become a normal person again.", "gen_completion": [" Your cousin Brittany is in Canada.

{"prefix": "Q: Why snitches get stitches\nA:", "gold_completion": "That only works if the people to whom you are snitching are all benevolent and their punishments are fair. Most criminal justice systems are still rife with abuses of power and systemic racism. A lot of crimes are directly a result of people being forced to live in systems of oppression. Many gangs were originally created to protect communities that were being either brutalized or ignored by law enforcement. A lot of drug dealers say they got into dealing because it was the only way they could imagine making enough money to buy nice things and provide for their families.   \n@@@In the US, the prison population is predominantly BIPOC and low-income, meaning they've experienced a lot of oppression before they entered. They may not have had access to adequate legal representation because our public defenders are criminally overworked. They're exploited for free or cheap labor (watch the 13th by Ava Duvernay), and they leave in debt and a record that will disqualify them from some jobs and housing and come up in background checks for those that are available.   \n@@@So, for a lot of incarcerated people, snitching is not going to protect people. It is going to serve the oppressors and offer up another person to be abused by the system. Even if you hate the \"bad guy,\" you may not want to see him fucked over by your greater enemy.   \n@@@Also, there's a long history of \"jailhouse snitches\" who lied. Sometimes they make up whatever they think will get them the best deal (usually years off their sentence), and sometimes law enforcement purposefully houses a snitch with someone awaiting trial so that they can get a \"confession.\"", "gen_completion": [" We are teaching kids the art of stitches.
